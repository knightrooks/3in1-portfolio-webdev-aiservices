    # Limit input length
    sanitized = sanitized[:1000]
    
    # Filter malicious patterns
    malicious_patterns = [
        r'javascript:',
        r'<script',
        r'eval\(',
        r'exec\(',
        r'system\(',
        r'__import__'
    ]
    
    for pattern in malicious_patterns:
        sanitized = re.sub(pattern, '', sanitized, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    
    return sanitized

# Rate limiting for AI endpoints
RATE_LIMITS = {
    'ai_chat': '100 per hour',

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

**Account Security:**
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Keep your email account secure
- Log out from shared devices
- Monitor account activity

**Data Security:**
- Don't share sensitive information in chats
- Verify SSL certificates
- Use secure networks
- Keep browsers updated
- Be cautious with file uploads

### For Developers

**Code Security:**
```python
# Input validation
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address
from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash

# Rate limiting
limiter = Limiter(
    app,
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"]
)

# SQL injection prevention
from sqlalchemy import text

# Bad - vulnerable to SQL injection
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# Good - using parameterized queries
query = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id")
result = db.execute(query, user_id=user_id)

# XSS prevention
from markupsafe import escape

def render_user_content(content):
    return escape(content)

# CSRF protection
from flask_wtf.csrf import CSRFProtect
csrf = CSRFProtect(app)
```

**Infrastructure Security:**
```yaml
# Docker security
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: 3in1-portfolio:latest
    user: "1000:1000"  # Non-root user
    read_only: true    # Read-only filesystem
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
# Environment security
export FLASK_ENV=production
export FLASK_DEBUG=False
export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
export REDIS_SSL=true
export MAIL_USE_TLS=true
