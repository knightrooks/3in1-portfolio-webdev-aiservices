## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering

#### Effective Strategic Analysis Prompts
```
Structure: Context + Specific Ask + Output Format + Constraints

Example:
"Given our SaaS company's current market position [context], 
analyze the competitive landscape and identify growth opportunities [specific ask].
Provide a structured analysis with strategic recommendations [output format]
within a $2M investment constraint [constraints]."
```

#### Problem-Solving Prompts
```
Structure: Problem Statement + Impact + Constraints + Desired Outcome

Example:
"Our customer churn rate increased 30% last quarter [problem + impact].
With limited engineering resources [constraint], 
provide a comprehensive solution framework [desired outcome]."
```

### Quality Optimization

#### Analysis Quality
- **Comprehensive Context**: Provide complete business context and constraints
- **Specific Objectives**: Clear definition of desired analysis outcomes
- **Framework Preference**: Specify preferred analytical frameworks when applicable
- **Success Criteria**: Define what constitutes successful analysis

#### Response Utilization
- **Structured Implementation**: Use structured analysis outputs for systematic implementation
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Adapt analysis depth for different audience levels
- **Follow-up Analysis**: Use initial analysis as foundation for deeper exploration
- **Decision Documentation**: Maintain records of analysis for future reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Overly Generic Analysis
**Problem**: Analysis lacks specificity for business context
**Solution**: Provide more detailed context and specific constraints

```python
# Generic (avoid)
prompt = "Analyze our business strategy"

# Specific (recommended)
prompt = """
Analyze our B2B SaaS strategy for the project management market.
Current: 1,000 users, $500K ARR, 15% monthly churn
Context: 3-person team, $100K runway, Series A target
Focus: Growth strategy with retention improvement
"""
```

#### Analysis Too High-Level
**Problem**: Recommendations lack implementable detail
**Solution**: Request specific implementation guidance

```python
prompt = """
... [business context] ...

Provide analysis including:
1. Specific action items with timelines
2. Resource requirements and responsibilities
3. Success metrics and measurement methods
4. Risk mitigation with contingency plans
"""
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Response Time
- Use appropriate `max_tokens` limits for analysis depth needed
- Consider `analysis_depth` parameter for balancing speed vs. comprehensiveness
- Cache frequent analysis types for similar business contexts

#### Analysis Quality
- Provide comprehensive business context and constraints
- Specify preferred analytical frameworks and methodologies
- Request structured outputs for better implementation utility

print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment_result['sentiment']}")
print(f"Confidence: {sentiment_result['confidence']:.1%}")
print(f"Analysis: {sentiment_result['analysis']}")
```
