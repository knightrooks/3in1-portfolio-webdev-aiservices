2. **Architecture Decisions**: System design and technology stack recommendations
3. **Code Optimization**: Performance improvements and refactoring assistance
4. **Security Hardening**: Vulnerability assessment and secure coding practices
5. **Learning & Education**: Explaining complex programming concepts with examples

### Prompt Engineering Tips
1. **Be Specific**: Include exact requirements, constraints, and expected outcomes
2. **Provide Context**: Share relevant project information, tech stack, and existing code
3. **Specify Language/Framework**: Mention target technologies and versions
4. **Include Constraints**: Performance requirements, security needs, deployment targets
5. **Request Explanations**: Ask for step-by-step explanations when learning

### Example Prompts
```
# Good Prompt
"Create a Flask API endpoint that handles user authentication with JWT tokens, 
includes input validation, rate limiting, and returns appropriate HTTP status codes. 
The user model should have email, password (hashed), and role fields."

# Enhanced Prompt
"I'm building a Flask application for a small business inventory system. Create a 
secure API endpoint for user login that:
- Validates email format and password strength
- Uses bcrypt for password hashing
- Returns JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- Implements rate limiting (5 attempts per minute)
- Logs security events
- Handles edge cases like account lockout
- Follows OWASP security guidelines
Please include error handling and unit tests."
```

## Model Behavior & Characteristics

## Integration Guidelines

### API Integration
```python
from models.deepseek_coder import DeepSeekCoder

# Initialize model
model = DeepSeekCoder(config)

# Generate code
response = await model.generate(
    prompt="Create a Flask route for user registration",
    max_tokens=2048,
    temperature=0.1
)

# Analyze existing code
analysis = await model.analyze_code(
    code=user_code,
    analysis_type="security"
)
```

### Configuration Options
```yaml
parameters:
  max_tokens: 8192        # Maximum response length
  temperature: 0.1        # Creativity vs consistency (0.0-1.0)
  top_p: 0.95            # Token selection threshold
  frequency_penalty: 0.0  # Reduce repetition
  presence_penalty: 0.0   # Encourage topic diversity
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times
- Simple queries: 1-3 seconds
- Complex implementations: 3-8 seconds
- Code analysis: 2-5 seconds
- Architecture discussions: 5-10 seconds

### Quality Metrics
- Code compilation rate: 95%+
- Security best practices adherence: High
- Performance optimization awareness: High
